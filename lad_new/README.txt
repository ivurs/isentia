Input files: 
There are two input files train_df_sample_clean.pkl and test_df_sample_clean.pkl which are cleaned sample data from raw files. They can be download from this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QTvaD2UFMuoMv2l5Vrd9JRel0gxlyQ90/view?usp=sharing

Reference files:
Two images files (ldavis_with_common_kw_test.jpg / ldavis_with_common_kw_train.jpg) which provide visualisation information of previous LDA model on training and testing set respectively

Modelling file: 
isentia_LDA_new.ipynb contains data loading, new LDA model and comparison between old and new models 

How to run the code:
1. Ensure input file (train_df_sample_clean.pkl and test_df_sample_clean.pkl), reference image files and modelling file(isentia_LDA_new.ipynb) are all in the same folder
2. Directly run isentia_LDA_new.ipynb to get the result step by step 


Brief conclusion has been drawn in the end of isentia_LDA_new.ipynb file.
