Input files: 
There are two input files train_df_sample.csv and test_df_sample.csv which generated by isentia_sample_data.ipynb, however, it is too large to upload to github, so please download from this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UljavHDxvrKNR92ubUoXxX2YhUNfVLB_/view?usp=sharing

Modelling file: 
isentia_modelling.ipynb contains data loading, data pre-processing and two different method for investigating this problem.

How to run the code:
1. Ensure input file (train_df_sample.csv and test_df_sample.csv) and modelling file(isentia_modelling.ipynb) are all in the same folder
2. Directly run isentia_modelling.ipynb to get the result step by step

Solution document.doc is all analysis and answers to the questions 

A little bit new findings:
As can be seen in this image new topic keyword result.jpg, after I conduct a text clean and applied more strict BOW dictionary filter rule as described in above doc file, I think topics are more clear, such as China-US trading war, Women Cancer and health, New energy and so on, but I understand there is a time limit, so will not update the code for now.
