Input files: 
There are two input files train_df_sample.csv and test_df_sample.csv which generated by isentia_sample_data.ipynb, however, it is too large to upload to github, so please download from this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UljavHDxvrKNR92ubUoXxX2YhUNfVLB_/view?usp=sharing

Modelling file: 
isentia_modelling.ipynb contains data loading, data pre-processing and two different method for investigating this problem.

How to run the code:
1. Ensure input file (train_df_sample.csv and test_df_sample.csv) and modelling file(isentia_modelling.ipynb) are all in the same folder
2. Directly run isentia_modelling.ipynb to get the result step by step
